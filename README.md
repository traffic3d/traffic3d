# Traffic 3D

[![pipeline status](https://gitlab.com/traffic3d/traffic3d/badges/develop/pipeline.svg)](https://gitlab.com/traffic3d/traffic3d/commits/develop)

Traffic3D is a new traffic simulation paradigm, built to push forward research in human-like learning (for example, based on photo-realistic visual input).
It provides a fast, cheap and scalable proxy for real-world traffic environments, based on the [Unity 3d](https://unity3d.com/unity) platform.
This implies effective simulation of diverse and dynamic 3D-road traffic scenarios, closely mimicking real-world traffic characteristics such as faithful simulation of individual vehicle behaviour, their precise physics of movement and photo-realism.
Traffic3D can facilitate research across multiple domains, including reinforcement learning, object detection and segmentation, unsupervised representation learning and visual question answering.

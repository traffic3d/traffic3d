Traffic3D is a new traffic simulation paradigm, built to push forward research in human-like learning (for example, based on photo-realistic visual input).
It provides a fast, cheap and scalable proxy for real-world traffic environments, based on the [Unity 3d](https://unity3d.com/unity) platform.
This implies effective simulation of diverse and dynamic 3D-road traffic scenarios, closely mimicking real-world traffic characteristics such as faithful simulation of individual vehicle behaviour, their precise physics of movement and photo-realism.
Traffic3D can facilitate research across multiple domains, including reinforcement learning, object detection and segmentation, unsupervised representation learning and visual question answering.

## CLI options

Traffic3D has custom command line options using following flag:
`-executeMethod CustomCommandLineArguments.Run`

The custom options are:

* `-JSONConfigFile "filename.json"` - Import settings from a JSON file (see below for config details)
* `-OpenScene "Scenes/sceneName.unity"` - Open a scene
* `-RunBenchmark true|false` - Run Benchmark

### Examples

```sh
# Using all custom options.
${UNITY_EXECUTABLE:-xvfb-run --auto-servernum --server-args='-screen 0 640x480x24' /opt/Unity/Editor/Unity} \
  -projectPath $(pwd)/Traffic3D \
  -testPlatform playmode \
  -testResults $(pwd)/playmode-results.xml \
  -executeMethod CustomCommandLineArguments.Run \
  -JSONConfigFile "config.json" \
  -OpenScene "Scenes/NightDemo.unity" \
  -RunBenchmark true \
  -logFile \
  -batchmode
```

If you are using a [Unity cache server](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/unity-cache-server) you can also add a line, such as: `-CacheServerIPAddress XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX:8126`.

## Configuration

Configuration is used to bulk import initialisation values into the Traffic3D system.
Normally the values are direct mappings of the values that can be changed within the Unity UI.
For example the `vehicleFactoryConfig` object within the config example below allows us to pass data directly to the specified fields.
e.g. The `highRangeRespawnTime` field in the config maps to the `highRangeRespawnTime` field in the game object.

### Examples

See [test_config.json](/Traffic3D/Assets/Tests/TestFiles/test_config.json) for an example of how to structure the file.

Urban Props Pack

This pack contains 3 props suitable for any urban environment: a rusty oil barrel, a full garbage bag and a street light. Each prop is lowpoly, and includes 512x512 diffuse maps (+alpha specularity) and normal maps, as well as custom lightmap UV's. I hope you enjoy them!

Feel free to drop me a line at adambadke@gmail.com , I would love to hear about any projects you might use these assets in.

All work by Adam Badke, an environment artist living and working in the Vancouver area (Check me out online: www.adambadke.com OR http://ca.linkedin.com/in/adambadke )

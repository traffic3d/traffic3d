If you find a bug and want to report it, or if you want to request a feature send me an email to:

For bug reports the best you can do to help me solve it is explain these things:
1. What type of bug is this? 
2. What were you doing when it it occurred?
3. What happened and what did you expect to happen?
If you can't answer all of these questions that's fine, however, please try as it helps me narrow done how to find the bug so I can fix it quicker. 
I always try to respond to all my emails within 24 hours during weekdays. However, if I have a lot to do it might take up to 72 hours. If I still haven't answered after 72 hours feel free to send me another one.
